Markov Chain extractor and player.


Reads midi file, extimates the Markov chain of the score process and make generative music playing the extracted markov chain.

Usage:

markovex [options] <file.mid|file.mch>

markovex -h
for help

If file is .mid, the program try to extract the markov chain associated to the score and dumps it in to file.mch

If file is .mch, the program instantiate an alsa sequencer port and starts to play a generative score according to markov process stored in file.mch
